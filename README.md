# Car-Data-Analysis
Car Data Analysis by Python and Streamlit


Data Source: https://www.kaggle.com/code/shubhamsinghgharsele/exploratory-data-analysis-on-automobile-dataset/data

Goal of this project:
Automobile Data visualization using Machine Learning.The objective of this report is to perform exploratory data analysis to find the primary relationships between features, which include univariate analysis, which
includes finding the maximum and minimum, such as the weight, engine size,
horsepower, and price. 


Exploratory Data Analysis:
Read the data as Pandas Dataframe
Check the data types and missing values
Check the basic statistics of numerical features
Find the percentage of unique values and reset the index,rename and round the catergorical variables

Exploring the data using different data visualization plots:


Barplot 


Scatterplot 


Histogram  


Distribution plot  


Boxplot 


Violinplot  


Heatmap .


In this Project I have Analyzed the Car Dataset and formed an Car Data Analysis web app using streamlit.Open main.py and type streamlit run main.py on its terminal it will open webapp.

Following are some of the images from Data Analysis webapp:
